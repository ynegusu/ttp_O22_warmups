-- DEBUGGING CODE IS A VERY IMPORTANT SKILL

-- Right out of this program, you're hired as a mid-level data analyst. So the
-- junior analysts come to you with problems! They just can't get the code to 
-- run! Fix all the error in each query to make it run, AND runs properly!

-- hint: Try to run parts of the query to see if they run at all. And don't 
-- forget to check the error message. They ARE actually helpful sometimes.

-- DON'T LOOK AT PREVIOUS WARMUPS! TRY TO DO ON YOUR OWN.
-- hint: 3 kinds of errors, all in the CASE WHEN STATEMENT
-- hint: check the strings
-- hint: are you finding what your looking for in your WHEN statements?
-- hint: Are you *done* with the CASE WHEN statement?
